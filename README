16 Bit CPU Emulator with 1024 16 bit slots of memory, 
an instruction set and a stack.

I have also written a small assembler in perl. (pasm.pl)

Please note: No inturrupt system is as yet implemented but I mean 
to add that functionallity after I develop some virtual hardware 
for it (screen, keyboard input system ect . . .).
