Each opcode must me entered as a 16 bit (4 digit) hex number
EG the opcode 03 to move the value of B to the A 
register must be written as 0300

Please note, that at the moment I have not written 
a compiler from assembly language to opcodes

Move Value to A: 01**
Move Value to B: 02**
Move Value of B to A: 03
Move Value of A to B: 04
Move Value out of memory location into A: 05**
Move Value out of memory location into B: 06**
Move Value from A to PC: 07
Move Value from B to PC: 08
Move value to PC: 09**
Move value of A into memory location: 0A**
Move Value of B into memory location: 0B**
Add A and B and store result in A: 0C
Add B and A and store the result in B: 0D
Add value to A and store result in A: 0E**
Add value to B and store result in B: 0F**
Subtract the value of B from A and store result in A: 10
Subtract the value of A from B and store result in B: 11
Subtract value from A and store result in A: 12
Subtract value from B and store result in B: 13
